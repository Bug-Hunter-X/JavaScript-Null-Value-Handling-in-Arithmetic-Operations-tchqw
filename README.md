# JavaScript Null Value Handling Bug

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, bug in JavaScript related to how null values are handled in arithmetic operations. The provided `foo` function attempts to gracefully handle null inputs by returning 0. However, this approach might not be suitable for all scenarios and can introduce unexpected behavior.

## Bug Description

The issue lies in the implicit type coercion that occurs when performing addition with null. Although the code explicitly checks for null values, other operations or contexts might not handle null values as expected.  This could lead to unexpected results or errors depending on the subsequent operations.

## Solution

The solution involves using more robust null checks and handling techniques, ensuring the function works as intended across different scenarios.
